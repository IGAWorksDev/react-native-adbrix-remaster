  - If you don't update your podspec with suitable version, it can cause errors such as critical crash or compile error.

4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`
  - Add `import org.domain.AdbrixPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new AdbrixPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```

  	project(':react-native-adbrix-remaster).projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/rreact-native-adbrix-remaster/android')
