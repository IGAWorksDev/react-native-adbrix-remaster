To change iOS xcframework version, after installing plugin from npm, go to node_modules/react-native-adbrix-remaster/react-native-adbrix-remaster.podspec, update native dependency:  **s.dependency 'AdBrixRemastered_XC', '1.0.0'**. Then use pod update command:
```
cd ios && pod update
```

## Installation

1. `$ npm install react-native-adbrix-remaster --save`
2. If React Native version <= 0.59
`$ react-native link react-native-adbrix-remaster`

Then run the following:

*iOS*

$ cd ios && pod install
$ react-native run-ios
```

*Android*

$ react-native run-android
```

> Starting from RN [v0.60](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/07/03/version-60), and react-native-adbrix-remaster `v1.4.6` the plugin uses [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md). <br/>
If your app does not support autolinking, follow steps below. You can also reference example app in this repository to learn more about manual link.

#### iOS

1. Add to pod file path to react-native-adbrix-remaster.podspec. Example: `pod 'react-native-adbrix-remaster', :path => '../..'`
2. You can find react-native-adbrix-remaster source files inside Development Pods > react-native-adbrix-remaster


#### Android

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`
  - Add `import io.adbrix.AdbrixPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new AdbrixPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
  ```
  @Override
        protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
          @SuppressWarnings("UnnecessaryLocalVariable")
          List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
          // Packages that cannot be autolinked yet can be added manually here, for example:
          // packages.add(new MyReactNativePackage());
          packages.add(new AdbrixPackage());
          return packages;
        }
  ```
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```
  	include ':react-native-adbrix-remaster
  	project(':react-native-adbrix-remaster).projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-adbrix-remaster/android')
  	```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```
      implementation project(':react-native-adbrix-remaster)
  	```
